### Brief ###

#### What does this application do? ####

Read the Features. They are inside the directory `features`. Look for files ending in `.feature` extension.

#### What's All About It? ####

I am using this Rails application, among others, when teaching my students. Things that are interesting are the following:

1. `Cucumber`. Has been used to describe the requirements of this application. 
2. `RSpec`. Has been used to describe the specification of the interfaces (unit tests).
3. `foreigner`. This gem has been used to define foreign keys.
4. `HAML`. Has been used as the view template language.
5. `Twitter Bootstrap`. Has been used as a CSS framework.
6. `SASS`. Has been used as the CSS preprocessor.
7. `simple_form`. Has been used to simplify the forms.
8. `site_prism`. Has been used to implement the [Page Object Pattern](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html). The page objects of the application can be found in their own directory: `page_objects`
9. `factory_girl`. Has been used to create instances with ease.
10. `selenium-webdriver`. Has been used in a couple of tests when javascript was necessary.
11. A full-page background image decorates the application. Nice technique to implement this has been found on [css-tricks](https://www.google.gr/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCgQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcss-tricks.com%2Fperfect-full-page-background-image%2F&ei=RSpmU4zWAomN7Qae8IGADg&usg=AFQjCNEhgsFuP7_T7nQ8VxEGzEt0rkktCw&bvm=bv.65788261,d.ZGU).
12. Ajax techniques to demonstrate how one can create a resource while editing another.
13. ...More about it, while teaching.
